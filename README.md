The 2 main reasons why I want to contribute to open source is:
1.Networking and Collaboration: Open source projects provide opportunities for networking and collaboration with developers from around the world. By engaging with the open source community, individuals can connect with like-minded individuals, build relationships, and expand their professional network. This can lead to new job opportunities, mentorship possibilities, and collaborations on future projects.
